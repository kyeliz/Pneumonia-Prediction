# Pneumonia-Prediction

## 🏢 Description
This project aims to develop a CNN model to detect Pneumonia using the provided dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
In this project, the Kaggle Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset was used. The dataset consists of three separate files: train, validation, and test. Within each, folders contains pneumonia and normal images.

## Project Organization

- 	Importing Dataset
-   Creating and Saving a Model
-   Making Predictions 


## About Model

While developing the CNN model, the Keras and TensorFlow libraries were used.
